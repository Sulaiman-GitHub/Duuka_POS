# Technical documentation

## Overview

Duuka POS is a single **Next.js 16** application (App Router) backed by **PostgreSQL** through **Prisma**. Pages are
React Server Components that read data directly on the server; changes go through **Server Actions**; a few
**route handlers** serve files (product images, CSV exports, a health check). There is no separate API service.

## Project layout

```
prisma/             schema.prisma, migrations/, seed.ts (demo data)
scripts/predeploy.ts  runs before `next build`: generate client → migrate → seed-if-empty
src/proxy.ts        first-line redirect to /login when there is no session cookie
src/app/
  login/            sign-in page and actions
  (app)/            everything behind sign-in: dashboard, pos, sales, products, inventory,
                    suppliers (+orders), reports, users, settings, audit
  api/              health, products/[id]/image, reports/csv
src/components/     ui primitives, hand-built SVG charts, sidebar
src/lib/            db, session, permissions, guard, inventory, sales, returns, analytics, reports,
                    settings, audit, money, time        ← business logic lives here, not in components
tests/              unit/ (pure logic) and integration/ (real PostgreSQL)

```

Business rules are deliberately kept in `src/lib` as plain functions that receive the database client as an argument
(`createSale`, `createReturn`, `applyStockChange`). Server actions are thin wrappers that authenticate, validate and
audit — which is what makes the rules directly testable.

## Roles and permissions

One map in `src/lib/permissions.ts` is used by the sidebar, page guards, server actions and API routes.

| Permission | Admin | Manager | Cashier |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Sell at the POS (`pos.sell`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| View own sales / receipts (`sales.view`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| View everyone's sales (`sales.viewAll`) | ✅ | ✅ | |
| Refund / return (`sales.refund`) | ✅ | ✅ | |
| Manage products & categories (`products.manage`) | ✅ | ✅ | |
| View inventory (`inventory.view`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Adjust stock (`inventory.adjust`) | ✅ | ✅ | |
| Reports & dashboard (`reports.view`, `dashboard.view`) | ✅ | ✅ | |
| Suppliers & purchase orders (`suppliers.manage`) | ✅ | ✅ | |
| Users, settings, activity log | ✅ | | |

Checks happen in three layers, so hiding a menu item is never the only protection:
1. `proxy.ts` redirects requests with no session cookie (a cheap, optimistic check only).
2. Every page calls `pageGuard(permission)`; every server action and route handler calls `requirePermission(...)`.
3. Row-level rules inside the logic: e.g. a cashier asking for someone else's receipt gets "not found".

## Authentication and sessions

- Passwords are hashed with **bcrypt** (cost 10). Unknown emails are compared against a dummy hash so response time
  doesn't reveal which accounts exist.
- A successful login sets a signed **JWT** (HS256, 12 h) in an `httpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, `Secure` (in production) cookie.
- The user is **re-read from the database on every request**, so deactivating an account or changing a role takes effect
  immediately — an open session is cut off at its next click.
- **Login throttling** is stored in the database (not process memory) so it holds across serverless instances: 8 failures
  per email+IP or 30 per IP in 10 minutes. Keying on the IP means a stranger can't lock a real user out of their own account.
- Users can't remove their own admin access, and the system always keeps at least one active admin.

## Security measures

| Area | Measure |
|---|---|
| Injection | All SQL is parameterised (Prisma queries and tagged-template raw SQL); no string-built queries |
| Input | Every action validates with **Zod** on the server; the browser is never trusted for prices, totals or permissions |
| XSS | React escapes output; strict **Content-Security-Policy**; no third-party scripts |
| Clickjacking / sniffing / transport | `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, HSTS, strict referrer policy |
| CSRF | Server Actions enforce same-origin; session cookie is `SameSite=Lax`; no state-changing GET endpoints |
| Uploads | Image type is decided by the file's **signature bytes**, not the browser-declared type; served with `nosniff` and a sandbox CSP |
| Export | CSV cells starting with `= + - @` are neutralised (spreadsheet formula injection) |
| Access control | Permission checks on every page, action and route; object-level checks on receipts |
| Auditing | Sign-ins, failed sign-ins and every change are written to an admin-visible activity log |
| Secrets | Only in environment variables; `.env` is git-ignored; the app refuses to start sessions without a 32+ character `SESSION_SECRET` |

## Money rules

All amounts are **whole Uganda Shillings stored as integers** — no floating-point rounding errors.

- **Prices come from the database.** The browser sends only product ids and quantities; `createSale` recomputes the
  subtotal, discount and total. A tampered request cannot change what is charged.
- **Price snapshots.** A sale line stores the unit price *and unit cost* at the time of sale, so later price changes never
  alter old receipts or historical profit.
- **Net sales** = sale total − refunds issued against it.
  **Gross profit** = net sales − cost of the items that were *not* returned. (Returned items are assumed to go back to stock.)
- **Refunds respect discounts.** A sale-level discount is shared proportionally across items, so returning one item
  refunds what was actually paid for it. When a return completes the sale, any rounding difference is settled so the
  refunds add up to *exactly* the amount paid.
- **Discount limits.** Cashiers may discount up to a configurable percentage (Settings, default 10%); the limit is
  enforced on the server.

## Inventory: the stock ledger

`products.stock` is the current balance, and **every change** also writes a row to `StockMovement` (type, signed
quantity, balance after, reason, reference, user). All changes go through one function, `applyStockChange`, inside a
database transaction:

```sql
UPDATE "Product" SET stock = stock + :delta WHERE id = :id AND stock >= :needed   -- atomic; fails if it would go negative
```

Movement types: opening stock, sale, customer return, purchase received, adjustment (+/−), damaged/expired.

## Concurrency

Tills can finish sales at the same instant, so correctness is enforced by the database, not by hoping requests arrive
politely:

| Risk | Protection |
|---|---|
| Two sales of the last unit | Conditional `UPDATE … WHERE stock >= n`; exactly one succeeds (tested: 12 simultaneous sales of 5 units → 5 succeed) |
| Duplicate receipt numbers | An atomic per-day counter (`ReceiptCounter` upsert) allocates `RCP-YYYYMMDD-NNNN`; numbering continues after any existing receipts |
| Two refunds of the same items | The sale row is locked (`SELECT … FOR UPDATE`) for the whole return |
| Double receiving of a purchase order | The order row is locked while stock is received |
| Half-finished sales | The sale, its lines, the stock changes and ledger rows are **one transaction** — it all happens or none of it does |

## Time zones

The shop operates in Uganda (UTC+3, no daylight saving) but servers run in UTC. Day boundaries for "today", reports,
receipt numbers and charts are computed explicitly in `Africa/Kampala` (`src/lib/time.ts`, and
`AT TIME ZONE` in SQL), and are covered by tests (e.g. 21:00 UTC is already tomorrow in Kampala).

## Reporting

`saleFacts()` in `src/lib/analytics.ts` is the single source for sales figures. It returns one row per sale with its
refunds and net cost of goods, and the dashboard, every report and the CSV export all derive from it — so the numbers
always agree. This was verified against an independent SQL query (231 transactions, UGX 7,976,750 net over the same
30 days on the demo data).

## Charts

The three charts are small hand-written SVG/HTML components (`src/components/charts.tsx`), not a charting library:
2 px lines, thin bars with rounded ends, hover and keyboard tooltips, direct labels, and a **table view** for each chart
so no information depends on seeing colour or using a mouse.

## Build and deploy pipeline

`npm run build` runs `scripts/predeploy.ts` first: generate the Prisma client → `prisma migrate deploy` → load demo data
**only if the database is empty**. Pushing to the production branch on Vercel therefore migrates the database and builds
the app in one step. A deliberate one-off reset is available with `RESET_DEMO_DATA=YES-DELETE-EVERYTHING`
(see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)).

Product images live in PostgreSQL (`bytea`) and are served by `/api/products/[id]/image`, because serverless hosting has
no persistent disk.

## Testing

`npm test` runs **52 tests** (Vitest).

| Suite | Covers |
|---|---|
| `tests/unit` | Permission matrix, Kampala day boundaries, money formatting, period bucketing and zero-filling, net/profit definitions, CSV escaping and formula-injection protection, report parameter handling |
| `tests/integration` | Against a real PostgreSQL database (`pos_test`, created and migrated automatically; skipped if Postgres isn't reachable): stock ledger rules and concurrency, selling (pricing, discounts, caps, rollback, receipt numbering, simultaneous sales), returns (proportional refunds, exact settlement, double-refund protection, concurrent refunds) and the reporting SQL |

Test runs refuse to start against any database whose name doesn't contain `test`. In addition, the application was
exercised end-to-end in a real browser (sign-in, every role's access, sales, refunds, purchase orders, reports, CSV, the
login lockout, phone layouts) during development.

## Design decisions

- **One Next.js app, no separate API.** Fewer moving parts to deploy and secure; Server Actions keep forms simple.
- **Integers for money, a ledger for stock.** Auditability and correctness matter more than convenience.
- **Domain logic outside actions.** Testable without HTTP, sessions or mocks.
- **Database-enforced concurrency.** Locks and conditional updates instead of application-level checks.
- **Re-reading the user each request.** A small query buys instant revocation, which a stateless token alone can't give.

## Known limitations

- **Demo credentials are public** by design; a real deployment would use private accounts and MFA.
- **Dependency advisories:** `npm audit` reports 4 findings (`prisma` CLI → `mysql2`, `deepmerge-ts`). They are in Prisma's
  command-line tooling, which runs only at build time; the running application uses the PostgreSQL driver and never loads
  `mysql2`. No patched 7.x release exists at the time of writing; the 8.x line is a release candidate with a different CLI.
- **Parked sales** are stored per browser (`localStorage`), not on the server.
- **PDF export** relies on the browser's *Save as PDF*; there is no server-side PDF generator.
- **Single currency (UGX)** and a single shop/location.
- **Sessions** are stateless JWTs: a stolen cookie works until it expires (12 h) or the user is deactivated.
